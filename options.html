          This plugin is designed to rapidly switch languages on
          <a href="https://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> without changing which
          content you're looking at, and without changing your account's
          language settings.<br>
          <br>
          If the current content is not available in the
          selected language you'll get either a "not found" or "access denied"
          error.<br>
          You can select which languages you want to switch between by
          selecting them below. Then close this window and return to Khan Academy.
